INTRODUCTION                                            *testify-introduction*

    Testify is a unit testing framework built using pure vim script for
    writing unit tests for vim script in pure vim script.

    It provides several commonly used assertions which leverage vim
    exception handling and allow execution of tests within vim itself,
    where your plugin is expected to work. This has an added advantage of
    being able to catch plugin conflicts easily.

==============================================================================
GETTING STARTED                                      *testify-getting-started*

    Writing tests with |testify| is done using pure vim script.

    For convenience |testify| provides |TestifyNearest|, |TestifyFile|,
    |TestifySuite| and |TestifyLast| commands to execute tests.

    You can place tests within your source files anywhere, however it is
    recommended that you place them in separate test files within
    a subdirectory named `t` under your plugin directory.

    A test looks like this : >

        function! s:TestFunction()
          call testify#assert#equals(1, 1)
        endfunction
        call testify#it('Test should pass', function('s:TestFunction'))
<
    When you execute the above test you should see the following output: >

        √ Test should pass
        * Test Summary
        * ------------
        * All tests successful
        * Tests=1
        * Result: PASS
<
    Lets look at an example of a failing test : >

        function! s:TestFunction()
          call testify#assert#equals(1, 2)
        endfunction
        call testify#it('Test should fail', function('s:TestFunction'))
<
    The output for the above failed test looks like this : >

        ✗ Test should fail
            Expected "1" to equal "2"
              <SNR>228_TestFunction:1
        * Test Summary
        * ------------
        * Tests=1
        * Fails=1
        * Result: FAIL

ASSERTIONS                                                *testify-assertions*

    Testify provides common assertions you might be familiar with from using
    other unit testing frameworks. The following is the list of all provided
    assertion apis :

                                                       *testify#assert#assert*
testify#assert#assert(condition)
    Generic assert api to which you can supply a condition which should
    evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

                                                       *testify#assert#equals*
testify#assert#equals(actual, expected)
    Asserts equality of actual with expected values.

                                                   *testify#assert#not_equals*
testify#assert#not_equals(actual, expected)
    Asserts for inequality of actual with expected values.

                                                      *testify#assert#matches*
testify#assert#matches(value, regexp)
    Asserts if a value matches the given regular expression.

                                                  *testify#assert#not_matches*
tesify#assert#not_matches(value, regexp)
    Asserts if a value does not match the given regular expression.

                                                        *testify#assert#empty*
testify#assert#empty(value)
    Asserts if a value is empty, piggy backs on the native |empty()|

                                                    *testify#assert#not_empty*
testify#assert#not_empty(value)
    Asserts if a value is not empty

                                              *testify#assert#raise_exception*
testify#assert#raise_exception(funcref, exception)
    Asserts that calling the given function raises an exception matching the
    given exception

                                          *testify#assert#not_raise_exception*
testify#assert#not_raise_exception(funcref)
    Asserts that calling the given function does not raise any exception.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                      *testify-options*

                                                         *testify#logger#type*
testify#logger#type
    Testify supports 3 logging methods :

    * `echo  ` : Uses vim's echo and outputs the tests execution logs on the
               standard vim command line
    * `shell`  : Uses `!echo` to output the test execution logs to the shell,
               this is set as the default when tests are invoked during vim
               startup using something like `vim +TestifySuite` and is useful
               for integration with a continous integration platform.

               NOTE: For compatibility with continous integration platforms,
               when executed during vim startup as described above, |testify|
               exits vim after running the tests with an appropriate exit code
               based on whether the tests passed or not.
    * `buffer` : Uses a preview buffer to show the test logs. This is the
               default.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                    *testify-commands*

                                                             *:TestifyNearest*
:TestifyNearest
    This allows you to be able to run and focus on an individual test. This
    works by searching for the next occurrence of `testify#it` and executes
    just that test.

    NOTE: This also repositions the cursor on the line where we found the next
    occurrence of `testify#it` for convenience.

                                                                *:TestifyFile*
:TestifyFile
    This executes all tests within the current vim script file.

                                                               *:TestifySuite*
:TestifySuite
    This executes all tests within all test files recursively within the
    subdirectory named `t` within the current working directory.

                                                                *:TestifyLast*
:TestifyLast
    This executes the most recently executed test command.
